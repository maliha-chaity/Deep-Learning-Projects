In this project, we have trained the CIFAR10 dataset which contains various types of images. The dataset has been trained using Convolutional Neural Network. After training the dataset, some images have been used to test if the model can predict the images properly. CIFAR-10 dataset is already available in the datasets module of Keras. We do not need to download it. We can directly import it from keras.datasets. We can also do this project using CIFAR-100 dataset. This project can also be done using CIFAR-100 dataset. In this case, we just need to replace CIFAR-10 with CIFAR-100 in image_classification_cifar10.py. Everything else will be the same. This is a very easy and ideal project for beginners.
